        description: >
          Fails if total_cases is not strictly increasing by date within each iso_code.
          This captures both decreases (invalid) and constants (indicates lack of update).

      - name: test_missing_dates_per_country
        description: >
          Fails if any iso_code has fewer distinct dates than the total number of dates in the dim_date table.
          This ensures temporal completeness for all countries across the expected calendar range.
